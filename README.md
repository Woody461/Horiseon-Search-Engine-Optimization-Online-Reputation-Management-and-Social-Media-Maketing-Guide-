# Module-challenge-1

In this challenge I gave the title a descriptive title.
I also labeled the sematic html elements so it is easier to find when insepceting the source code
I also added alt attributes to the images just in case the images broke somehow there would be a discription of the pictures

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
